## Pneumatic Artificial Muscle Nonlinear Dynamics Analysis
**Nonlinear GNC framework for Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs). Features NLARX system identification (Sigmoid, Wavelet, idTreePartition) and robust state estimation (Kalman Filters) designed to reject complex hysteresis-induced bias and non-differentiable gradient spikes. Also contains Monte Carlo regarding Unscented Kalman Filter and Model Predictive Control.** 

**Preface**: Traditional industry estimators (EKF/CKF) fail on soft-actuator dynamics due to inherent hysteresis and non-differentiable gradient spikes. In this repository, a series of reports aims to create a unified workflow that models, estimates, and predicts a solution to dealing with nonlinear hysteretic actuators. 
## Core Success Metrics & Results 
* Model Fidelity - Achieved a 98.2% fitness match using Sigmoid-NLARX models, significantly outperforming standard linear approximations in capturing hysteresis drift inherent to soft actuators. 
* Bias Rejection - Successfully eliminated -7.5mm tracking bias inherent in EKF/CKF implementations by using a tuned Unscented Kalman Fulter. 
* Jacobian Diagnostics - Quantified non-differentiable gradient spikes, providing a mathematical basis for the Linearization trap that plagues and causes standard industry estimators to fail.

## **Roadmap**
This repository is organized into three distinct technical reports that follows **Input $\rightarrow$ Evidence $\rightarrow$ Decision framework**. This functionally amounts to a **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)** stack-equivalent. 

1. **01-NLARX-SysID-Estimation**: Comparison of different models (NLARX models vs different Kalman Filters) and rejection of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) in favor of Unscented Kalman Filter

2. **02-Monte-Carlo-KalmanFilter**: (Work In Progress) Statistical verification of estimator robustness across randomized initial conditions. 

3. **03-Nonlinear-MPC**: (Work In Progress) Real-Time Tracking of Fourier-series references using the NLARX PLant Models for Model Predictive Controls. 

4. **04-GNC-Integration**: (Planned). Integrate and expand all three scripts into a single framework and create a coherent closed-loop Model Predictive Control solution. 

5. **Notice**: Future works may expand or extend the reports here for publications (not limited to the aforementioned journals). This repository is intended to validate and serve as a sample of the work that can be extended to the Industry.
